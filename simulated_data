We generated total of 21 datasets of simulated pair-end reads from 100 isoform transcripts（stored in ref_trans.fa and ref_trans.gtf）originated from 41 different genes in chromosome 1 (CRCh38.83, NCBI) using FluxSimulator. Each simulated dataset contains 0.1 million paired-end reads. For example, sim100bp_1.fa and sim100bp_2.fa contain 0.1 million 
paired-end reads with length 100bp.
